**Traffic Sign Recognition**

We have worked on the high prep statement- German traffic sign recognition model along with a User Interface frame which itself allows user to augment test images and introduce new 5 classes.

This is a Deep Learning model developed using keras. It is used to recognise traffic signals. It was initially on the German Traffic Sign Recognition data set which was the baseline for this model. Later, 5 new classes were added to this model and the model was retrained to increase the difficulty of the data set. Then using an app called streamlit, the UI was created that enabled the user to play with the augmentations and visualise the results in terms of the accuracy and loss metrics. UI provided is very user friendly.
